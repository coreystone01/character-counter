# Frontend Mentor - Character counter


The following is a solution for the Character Counter challenge from FrontEndMentor.io

The website was built using Bootstrap and JQuery to print the progress bars dynamically as you type in the textarea.

The expected behavior is that you type in the text area and the webpage should calculate your total character (excluding spaces if you want),
calculate your word count and calculate your sentence count. You should then be able to see the letter density for each character you typed and stats
for each calculation displayed in different stat cards and progress bars.
